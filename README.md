A mod for Call of Duty: World At War zombies. 

So far features include:
- Local Player Health Bar
- Show Number of Zombies left on screen
- Zombie Tracers
- Entity Type Tracers
- Infininte Ammo
- Player Debug Information (Coordinates, Facing Direction)
- Aimbot (Very bad as of right now)

I have only tested/developed this for Singleplayer. This is simply a test project for me. 

And yes, I am aware that console commands can achieve 90% of what im doing... But that isnt the point. Once again, this is a test project for me, and I am trying to learn how to manage slightly larger codebases and also learning more advanced game modding features.


To Use:
Compile the project in x86 Release, and inject into CoDWaW.exe with your favorite injector.
